# Astral Compatibility

## Project Overview

Astral Compatibility is a revolutionary privacy-preserving astrological compatibility analysis system built on blockchain technology. This application enables users to discover zodiac compatibility matches without revealing sensitive personal information such as exact birth times and locations.

## Core Concept

### Privacy Astrology Compatibility Matching - Astrological Compatibility Analysis System

Our innovative platform leverages advanced cryptographic techniques to provide accurate astrological compatibility analysis while maintaining complete user privacy. Users can:

- **Discover Compatibility**: Match with compatible zodiac signs based on astrological principles
- **Preserve Privacy**: Protect sensitive birth data through zero-knowledge proofs
- **Secure Analysis**: Utilize blockchain-based smart contracts for transparent and immutable compatibility calculations
- **Anonymous Matching**: Connect with compatible individuals without exposing personal details

## Key Features

- **Privacy-First Design**: No personal birth information is stored or exposed
- **Blockchain Security**: All compatibility data secured on the blockchain
- **Real-time Matching**: Instant compatibility analysis and matching
- **Cryptographic Protection**: Advanced encryption ensures data privacy
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for seamless user experience
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on all devices

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Modern web technologies for responsive user interface
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Sepolia testnet)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity with Zama FHE library for secure compatibility calculations
- **Cryptography**: Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy preservation
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask support for blockchain interactions

## Smart Contract Address

The core compatibility analysis smart contract is deployed on Sepolia testnet:
- **Contract Address**: `0xeFF7Db1fc1CdcB2Ddf07083DE26617B24bB1AAe4`
- **Network**: Sepolia (Chain ID: 11155111)

## Demonstration Materials

### Video Demonstration
The project includes a comprehensive video demonstration showcasing:
- Platform functionality and user interface
- Privacy-preserving compatibility matching process
- Real-time astrological analysis features
- User journey from registration to compatibility discovery

### Blockchain Transaction Screenshots
Transaction evidence and blockchain interaction screenshots are included, demonstrating:
- Smart contract deployment and verification
- Live compatibility analysis transactions
- Privacy-preserving data handling on-chain
- User interaction with blockchain components

## Astrological Foundation

Our compatibility system is built upon traditional astrological principles including:
- **Elemental Compatibility**: Fire, Earth, Air, and Water sign interactions
- **Modal Relationships**: Cardinal, Fixed, and Mutable sign dynamics
- **Planetary Influences**: Consideration of ruling planets and their relationships
- **Aspect Analysis**: Angular relationships between celestial bodies
- **Synastry Principles**: Comparative chart analysis techniques

## Privacy Technology

The platform implements cutting-edge privacy technologies:
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Prove compatibility without revealing birth data
- **Fully Homomorphic Encryption**: Perform calculations on encrypted data using Zama's FHE technology
- **Secure Multi-Party Computation**: Enable collaborative analysis without data exposure
- **Blockchain Anonymity**: Leverage pseudonymous blockchain transactions

## How It Works

1. **Create Profile**: Enter your zodiac information, which gets encrypted using FHE
2. **Request Match**: Find compatibility with another user's encrypted profile
3. **View Results**: Compatibility scores are calculated privately and revealed only to participants
4. **Privacy Preserved**: All personal astrological data remains encrypted throughout the process
